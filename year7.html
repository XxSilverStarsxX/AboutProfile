        "In '32, games shall grace my name,
        A legacy built, a creator's claim.
        Award-winning gems, my mark profound,
        Game developer's crown, forever renowned.
        
        Multitudes of roles, voice acting grand,
        In games, anime, audiobooks in demand.
        Emotions unveiled, stories brought to life,
        Through voice's jazz, the world shall rife.
        
        Fatherhood's journey, a love everlasting,
        In their lives, my presence amassing.
        Guiding their steps, hearts intertwined,
        A bond unbreakable, love redefined.
        
        By '37, an educator I shall rise,
        Unlocking brilliance, minds shall prize.
        A beacon of knowledge, a guiding light,
        Igniting potential, dreams taking flight.
        
        In '42, at forty-one's prime,
        Still active, preparing the next paradigm.
        Educator or headmaster, nurturing the way,
        Passing the torch, the future's sway.
        
        '47 whispers retirements gentle plea,
        A quiet life embraced, supporting family.
        On the path of tranquility, a peaceful retreat,
        Fulfilling dreams, life's rhythm complete.
        
        '52 brings grandchildren, a new chapter unfolds,
        Spoiling their joy, love that never grows old.
        A supporter unwavering, in family's embrace,
        Community, country, held with grace.
        
        Jazz poetry weaves this tale so sweet,
        Every detail preserved, none shall delete.
        A melody of aspirations, dreams set free,
        In the jazz of life, harmonious and key."</p2>
