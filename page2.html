    <h2 style="background-image: url(2413176.jpg);"> I am honored to have received the Indie Game of the Year award for 2048 and grateful for the hard work that led to this achievement.

        Before COVID, I was working on completing game development classes at MATC. I completed a help-desk certification there and took a job at Digital Bridge as a PC refurbisher. While working there full-time, I was simultaneously developing my first game. I put in a lot of effort, passion, and creativity into the game development. In 2022, I faced a critical moment where I had to choose between my job and game development. The choice was made for me, and after losing my job, I decided to pursue game development full-time.
        
        Feeling lost in life, I decided to take a break to reflect on myself and my life.
        
        I knew then that I wanted to become a better version of myself. A group of friends and I went to a job fair searching for the next step. I met Melissa there, filled out the paperwork, and began the program in 2023. My time at IC Stars was transformative. I dedicated many hours to learning, persevering through Geek Week, and making valuable connections. I learned that while I thought I could not do well in a harsh work environment, I could make mistakes and continue forward despite them.
        
        My journey to success was difficult and challenging, but I remained determined and focused on achieving my goals. 
        
        I worked my way up from being a help desk clerk to becoming a software developer while refining my skills and gaining experience. 
        
        In my free time, I went back to that first game and finished it. I put my heart and soul into creating something extraordinary. This game got me noticed in the gaming industry.
        
        After a few years, I took the bold step of quitting my job and financing my project through crowdfunding. It was a proud moment for me to release the game to the public and be recognized as a top contender for the Indie Game of the Year award.
        
        I am grateful for the support of my mother and friends, who encouraged me to follow my dreams and be the best version of myself. I learned that every setback and challenge was an opportunity for growth and development.
        
        With hindsight, I am now excited to embark on my next adventure, ready to take on new challenges with optimism and eagerness. I extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who helped me along the way.
